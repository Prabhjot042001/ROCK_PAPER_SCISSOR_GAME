# ROCK_PAPER_SCISSOR_GAME

**AIM:** To build a stone paper scissor game on python that uses hand gesture algorithm to detect the gestures made by hand for stone, paper, and scissor by player 1 and player 2 for particular number of chances.

**DESCRIPTION:** As per the Aim two players will show their hand gestures on the screen and the computer will detect the gesture using image processing and ML and declare the winner. The opencv will detect the gesture of hand and on the basis of convexity defects will make a prediction for a particular gesture.
The GUI is created which asks the user to play with computer as single player or two player game

**SKILLS REQUIRED:** Python ,Image processing, Machine learning and good understanding of Opencv library in python, Numpy library.
